# BBB-Permeability-Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for predicting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the permeability of compounds through the blood-brain barrier using molecular descriptors and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the B3DB classification dataset. It contains molecular descriptors for various compounds along with their permeability status.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- RDKit
- Mordred
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dixit07-dtsc/BBB_Permeability_Prediction.git
   cd BBB_Permeability_Prediction
